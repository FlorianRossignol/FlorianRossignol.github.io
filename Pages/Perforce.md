## PerforceSetup 

For the Project I need to place an environment source control for all teams like working togheter like audio and art, we decide to go on perforce based on the industry prerequired and much storage for the large file like blueprint.

First we have to setup the server Perforce based on the shool server I download p4 service directly in root server, after that we have to setup the admin profile, I go name a profile and a password for that.

I write for team an document which traces my research and explanation concerning perforce.

## PerforceClient

After setup correctly the admin profile i need first to create account for the rest of game prog team, installed perforce service in the root server team and other can download the Peforce Client.

In this case we have some functionality:

- **Get Latest** (For the update and download the new file for the server.)
- **Refresh** (Refresh the database.)
- **Submit** (Submit your new file to the server.)
- **Checkout** (With checkout the file you only can edit this.)
- **Add** (For adding the new file in the server.)

## p4ignore

After to create and explains how to us perforce in the team I need to create and setup the "p4 ignore, the p4 ignore is used for ignoring the file, I specified file to the p4ignore to get ignore for adding the new file.

some file in this case dont need to push in the server.

## Problems

I encounter one big problem during the phase of production. Perforce is free until five users created, but for the project we have large more user work in the project, so I need to contact support. These problems create an entire shutdown for Perforce server, all the team cant add the new file until 2 weeks later.	After this have an licence for all users and get a normal traffic for Perforce server.

## Conclusion

After the project I have some massive skill in Perforce software, for the future is so used in the industry and I have the skill for the demand

**Specially for: **

------------

- Installed and setup the Perforce server
- To create a p4 ignore and setup correctly in Perforce client.
- Update a licence and managing the Perforce server.
- Skill for Perforce software.

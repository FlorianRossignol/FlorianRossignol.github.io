## PerforceSetup 

For the Project I need to place an environment source control for all teams like working togheter like audio and art, we decide to go on perforce based on the industry prerequired and much storage for the large file like blueprint.

First we have to setup the server Perforce based on the shool server I download p4 service directly in root server, after that we have to setup the admin profile, I go name a profile and a password for that.

I write for team an document which traces my research and explanation concerning perforce.

## PerforceClient

After setup correctly the admin profile i need first to create account for the rest of game prog team, installed perforce service in the root server team and other can download the Peforce Client.

In this case we have some functionality:

- **Get Latest** (For the update and download the new file for the server.)
- **Refresh** (Refresh the database.)
- **Submit** (Submit your new file to the server.)
- **Checkout** (With checkout the file you only can edit this.)
- **Add** (For adding the new file in the server.)

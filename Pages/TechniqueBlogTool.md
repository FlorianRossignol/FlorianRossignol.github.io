1 Introduction to the tool

For my 5100 module I had to be assigned to a tool among those available to help the third years on their game!

I chose the tool cheating to 1 have a solo project and see how I did 
and it was the one I wanted the most.


2 Constraint and resolution 

For my tool I had constraints, in particular I had to answer the needs of the game designer, 
why have unlimited money? Why to have electricity and water as well as to control the arrival of the tourists? 
The answer was quite simple: 
to test the different functionalities of the game, you have to be able to do it.
What if the game designer can't buy all the buildings in the game at once? how can he know if the game doesn't lag with 40 tourists on the screen? This is where I come in.


3 Designing the tool and learning 

Here I am in the bath, now I have to design the tool 

I first designed a widget to create my tool:

IMMMAGE

then I was able to organize the widget with what I needed 

IMMMAGE

and the different functions : 


IMMMAGE 

To finish I just had to finish my functions:

IMAGGGE

to put a way to activate and deactivate the tool :


IMAGGGE



And there you go.

4 going further 

Now what a tool can it serve during a large-scale use, during a company for example?
one can very well imagine the same problems as me (to need to test if and that and to reach it easily) one can also create some to add a functionality in more pars example to convert a file in png containing jpeg in a software which does not take this conversation into account. 
The tool is directly linked to the creation of game without that difficult to advance correctly.
